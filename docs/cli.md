# CLI - mzoon
---

`mzoon` is a MoonZoon CLI tool.

_

You'll be able to install `mzoon` with _Cargo_ soon: 
```sh
cargo install --locked mzoon
```
but for now, you can use:
```sh
cargo install mzoon --git https://github.com/MoonZoon/MoonZoon --rev 15cb619faca5f78a47e08f4af4bfa595f0eb64b1 --root cargo_install_root --locked
```

and faster installation methods with pre-compiled binaries will follow.

- Notes:
   - You can use the [demo](https://github.com/MoonZoon/demo) as a template for your new project for now.
   - Why [_--locked_?](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7169)

## MoonZoon.toml

- The configuration file located in the app root directory.

```toml
port = 8080
# port = 8443
https = false
cache_busting = true # add UUID to file names - e.g. `frontend_bg_[uuid].wasm`
backend_log_level = "warn" # "error" / "warn" / "info" / "debug" / "trace"

[redirect] # useful for HTTP -> HTTPS redirect
port = 8081
enabled = false

[watch]
frontend = [
    "frontend/Cargo.toml",
    "frontend/src",
]
backend = [
    "backend/Cargo.toml",
    "backend/src",
]
```

## FAQ
1. _"What about other commands like `deploy` and `test`?"_
   - Other commands will be added later.
   - You can use standard `cargo test` for testing the backend side.
   - `mzoon build` automatically installs `wasm-pack` in the `frontend` directory. So you can use `wasm-pack` directly for testing.

1. _"How can I change the port number or enable HTTPS?"_

   - _For development_: Update settings in `MoonZoon.toml` (see `MoonZoon.toml` above or `/examples/counter/MoonZoon.toml`)

   - _For production_: Set environment variables (see `/crates/moon/src/config.rs`)

1. _"Some commands or parameters mentioned above don't work!"_
   - They are probably not implemented yet.

1. _"What is a new project file structure?"_
   - See the content of [MoonZoon/demo](https://github.com/MoonZoon/demo) to have an idea.
