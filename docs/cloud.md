## FAQ
1. _"How it works?"_
   - MoonZoon Cloud will be designed and developed once the MoonZoon framework is stable enough.

1. _"I want to deploy my MoonZoon app now!"_

   - There is a [buildpack](https://github.com/MoonZoon/heroku-buildpack-moonzoon) for Heroku and Heroku-like PaaS and the [demo](https://github.com/MoonZoon/demo).

   - It should be possible to modify buildpack's code and setup, for instance, GitHub Actions as your own deploy pipeline. Don't hesitate to write about your intentions on our [chat](https://discord.gg/eGduTxK2Es).
